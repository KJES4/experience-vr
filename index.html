            <p><span>Strap on a rectangular black headset, and you can traverse a sunken ship at the bottom of the ocean, explore the depths of outer space, or climb to the top of a snowcapped mountain. That’s the promise of virtual reality (VR) headsets, like the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive. Virtual reality is a computer-generated environment that lets you experience a different reality. While that may seem like a dream come true in the gaming world what does that mean for the rest of us? How will virtual reality affect you? Throughout this site, we'll explore this question along with much more as we learn about this exciting new frontier that is <strong>Virtual reality</strong>.</span></p>

                <h3>What is Virtual Reality?</h3>
                <p>By: Virtual Reality Society</p>
              </header>
              <p>The definition of virtual reality comes, naturally, from the definitions of both ‘virtual’ and ‘reality’. The definition of ‘virtual’ is near and reality is what we experience as human beings. So the term ‘virtual reality’ basically means ‘near-reality’. This could, of course, mean anything but it usually refers to a specific type of reality emulation. We know the world through our senses and perception systems. In school, we all learned that we have five senses: taste, touch, smell, sight, and hearing. These are however only our most obvious sense organs. The truth is that humans have many more senses than this, such as a sense of balance for example. These other sensory inputs, plus some special processing of sensory information by our brains ensures that we have a rich flow of information from the environment to our minds.

                <h3>Real-World Uses for Virtual Reality</h3>
                <p>By: Jane Wakefield</p>
              </header>
              <p>Think of virtual reality and you will probably conjure up images of fantastical landscapes in a game or film set. But VR can also be embedded in reality to give people more understanding of the world around them. Increasingly it is being used as a tool by journalists, teachers, healthcare workers, and retailers. The BBC took a look at a few of the more unexpected uses of the technology.
